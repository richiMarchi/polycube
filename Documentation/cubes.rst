Cubes Architecture
==================

A ``Cube`` is a logical entity, composed by a ``data plane`` (which can include one or more eBPF programs) and a ``control/management plane``.

In addition, a Cube may include also a ``slow path`` in case some additional data plane-related code is required to overcome some limitations of the eBPF data plane.

Types of Cubes
--------------

Polycube has two diferent kind of cubes, **standard cubes** and **transparent cubes**.

Standard cubes have forwarding capabilities, such router and bridge.

A standard cube:
  - defines a :ref:`ports <cube-ports>` concept, ports are *connected* to other ports or netdevs;
  - makes a forwarding decision, i.e, sending the packet to another port;
  - it follows middle-box model, is a network function with multiple ports;

::

             standard cube
           +--------------+
           |              |
           | +----------+ |
   port1---|-|          |-|---port3
           | |   core   | |
   port2---|-|          |-|---port3
           | +----------+ |
           |              |
           +--------------+

A trasparent cube is a cube without any forwarding capability, such as a network monitor, NAT and a firewall.

A trasparent cube:
  - does not define any port, but has to be *attached* to an existing port such as the one of a normal service (e.g., port1 on router2) or a network interface in the host (e.g., veth0);
  - cannot be *connected* to other services, but *attached*.
  - it *inherits* all the parameters associated to ports (e.g., MAC/IPv4 addresses, link speed, etc.) from the actual port it is attached to (e.g., port 1 on router2, or veth0);
  - it allows to have a stack of transparent services on top of a port, very similar to a stack of functions.

      | \  +---------+  / |
      |  <-| egress  |<-  |
      |    +-------- +    |

``polycubectl ?`` shows available cubes installed on your system.

Cubes structure
---------------

Cubes Instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cubes are created by the ``polycubectl <cubetype> add <cubename>`` command, for example:
::

  # create a router instance called r1
  polycubectl router add r1
  # create a simplebridge instance br1
  polycubectl simplebridge add br1


.. _cube-ports:

Create Ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cubes can send/receive traffic through ``ports``.

NOTE: Just create a port does NOT allow to send/receive traffic.

Ports are created using ``polycubectl <cubename> ports add <portname> [parameter=value, [parameter1=value1, ...]]``.

In order to ``send/receive traffic``, the user has to setup the ``peer`` value or use the equivalent ``connect`` primitive. More details next.

Ports are logical entities and need to be connected to (physical/virtual) network interfaces or to other ports to be fully operational.

                 +----------+                                     +---------+
     port1 ------|    r1    |------- port2----------port2---------|   br1   |
    (netdev)     |  (cube)  |     (cube port)     (cube port)     |  (cube) |
    peer=veth1   +----------+   peer=br1:port2   peer=r1:port1    +---------+
                       |
                       |
                     port3
                    (netdev)
                   peer=eth0


For instance:
::

  # create port2 on br1 (simplebridge), it doesn't require any further parameters
  polycubectl br1 ports add port2

  # create portX on r1 (router), it requires ip and netmask parameters
  polycubectl r1 ports add port1 ip=10.0.1.1 netmask=255.255.255.0
  polycubectl r1 ports add port2 ip=10.0.2.1 netmask=255.255.255.0
  polycubectl r1 ports add port1 ip=10.0.3.1 netmask=255.255.255.0

Connect Ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two primitives are available: ``set peer`` or ``connect``.

Set peer
--------

The ``peer`` parameter defines where the port is connected to, it is possible to connect ports to linux netdevs or to ports belonging to other cubes.

- set peer to a ``netdev`` name in order to connect to it, (``eth0``, ``wlan0``, ``veth1``...)
- set peer to ``cube_name:port_name`` to connect the port to the port of another cube. (e.g. ``br1:port1``). In this case the peer on both ports have to be set in order to create the connection.

If the ``peer`` is empty it means the port is down, so packets are not received from it, and packets sent through it are dropped.

Following is an example, referred to previous picture.
::

  #using set peer
  polycubectl r1 ports port1 set peer=veth1
  polycubectl r1 ports port3 set peer=eth0
  polycubectl r1  ports port2 set peer=br1:port2
  polycubectl br1 ports port2 set peer=r1:port2

Connect
-------

The ``connect`` primitive provides an alternative way to connect ports.

- connect to a ``netdev`` - Use ``polycubectl connect <cube1>:<port1> <netdev>``
- connect to ``cube_name:port_name`` - Use ``polycubectl connect <cube1>:<port1> <cube_name>:<port_name>``


Following is an example, referred to previous picture.
::

  #using connect
  polycubectl connect r1:port1 veth1
  polycubectl connect r1:port3 eth0
  polycubectl connect r1:port2 br1:port2


Attach and Detach primitives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These primitives allow to associate transparent cubes to standard cube's ports or to netdevs on the system.

::

  polycubectl attach firewall1 r1:port2

  polycubectl attach firewall0 veth1
